                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>The values used for the top and left properties are 90 pixels and 30 pixels and it moved the box down by 90 pixels</p>

                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>The values used for the top and right properties are 90 pixels and 10 pixels and moved the viewport 90 pixels down and 10 to the right</p>

            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>

                <p>The values used for the bottom and right properties are 0 pixels and moved the box to the bottom of the other boxes </p>
